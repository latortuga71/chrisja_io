      <description>AWS doesnt offer ephemeral workspaces at this point in time. So i was tasked with finding a solution and seeing if this was possible. Searching online i didnt find much. But i did find a way to work through this problem. Using lambda functions, Cloud Watch , Cloud Trail &amp;amp;Workspaces of course.
In my repo i have a pdf explaining how it works (hopefully well) its basically three lambda functions. One function triggers when a new workspace is created, and creates a cloud watch rule on it to see if it disconnects or logs off.</description>
