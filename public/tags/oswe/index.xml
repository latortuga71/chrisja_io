      <description>On the heels of passing my OSWE exam i wanted to write up a quick post to reassure people on the difficulty level of the exam. As there seems to be some misinformation regarding exactly how difficult it is. In short i would say its difficult but doable. Alot of posts seem to point in the direction of it being a huge codebase that is impossible to go through. That was not my experience.</description>
