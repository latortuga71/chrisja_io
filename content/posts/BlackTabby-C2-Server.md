I wanted to learn more about C2 Servers, so i tried to write my own. And i was semi-successful. It works. But its not neccesarily useful for others in my opinion. I think my biggest mistake was using couch db as the database. Using sqlLite would have been better i think. I will definitely pursue this again. As it wasnt as hard as i thought and most likely will try the same formula again but with a different DB and perhaps writing the server in C (As i think it would help me get better). Writing an agent in powershell and C# also helped me get into those languages a little more as well. [repo](https://github.com/latortuga71/Black_Tabby)
